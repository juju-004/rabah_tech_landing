              Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.
            </h5>
            <p>
              Bitcoin is one of the most important inventions in all of human
              history. For the first time ever, anyone can send or receive any
              amount of money with anyone else, anywhere on the planet,
              conveniently and without restriction. Itâ€™s the dawn of a better,
              more free world.
